# The-Michael-Jackson-Experience
This was the last project I developed as a student at the Academia de CÃ³digo, a hackthon that took 24 hours to complete. The theme of this hackthon was "Juke-Box", each group had a song and an artist, our theme was the POP musical genre with the song "They Dont Care About Us" by Michael Jackson. Our project consisted of an interactive website to give our users greater immersion and fun on our site. Within the site we had a small quiz about Michael Jackson, a space to take a selfie with MJ and a social part that was a forum for people to talk about what they've been through with police force, racism and all the causes that the song portrays. The project was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
